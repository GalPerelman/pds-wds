# Coordinated Operational Optimization of Water and Power Systems under Emergency Conditions

This research explores the integrated management of Water Distribution Systems (WDS) and Power Distribution Systems (PDS) for improved operational efficiency and resilience under extreme scenarios. Traditionally, these systems are operated independently leading to sub-optimal operational efficiency. Alternatively, some studies proposed a joint operation of WDS and PDS but assumed that decisions are made simultaneously by a single decision-maker, which is impractical. This study offers a novel approach for emergency control based on sparse communication between WDS and PDS operators to enhance resilience and improve the integrated systemsâ€™ functionality. The primary objective is to minimize the load shedding in the PDS through strategic demand management in the interconnected WDS, demonstrating the potential of collaborative decision-making between these two critical infrastructure systems. The paper highlights the significance of cross-sectoral collaboration, presenting a viable pathway for managing local infrastructure systems under extreme conditions while ensuring uninterrupted service delivery to communities.
